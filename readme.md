# Destiny Gear Manager

This is _very much_ a work in progress.

I want to build a Destiny item comparison and management tool with better usability than the other tools out there.

Info about the public Bungie API [here](https://bungie-net.github.io/multi/index.html).

## Todo

- [x] Add Bungie OAuth
- [ ] Add UI to show available items
- [ ] Add UI for comparing available items
- [ ] Implement moving of items between characters/vault
